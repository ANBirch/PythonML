    "\n",
    "There are a myriad of decisions you must make when designing and configuring your deep learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of these decisions can be resolved by copying the structure of other people’s networks and using heuristics. Ultimately, the best technique is to actually design small experiments and empirically evaluate options using real data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This includes high-level decisions like the number, size and type of layers in your network. It also includes the lower level decisions like the choice of loss function, activation functions,  optimization procedure and number of epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning is often used on problems that have very large datasets. That is tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, you need to have a robust test harness that allows you to estimate the performance of a given configuration on unseen data, and reliably compare the performance to other configurations.\n",

    "## Data Splitting\n",
    "\n",
    "The large amount of data and the complexity of the models require very long training times.\n",

    "### Use a Automatic Verification Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Keras can separate a portion of your training data into a validation dataset and evaluate the performance of your model on that validation dataset each epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can do this by setting the **validation_split** argument on the **fit()** function to a percentage of the size of your training dataset.\n",

    "## Manual k-Fold Cross Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "The gold standard for machine learning model evaluation is [k-fold cross validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)).\n",
    "\n",
    "It provides a robust estimate of the performance of a model on unseen data. It does this by splitting the training dataset into k subsets and takes turns training models on all subsets except one which is held out, and evaluating model performance on the held out validation dataset. The process is repeated until all subsets are given an opportunity to be the held out validation set. The performance measure is then averaged across all models that are created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross validation is often not used for evaluating deep learning models because of the greater computational expense. For example k-fold cross validation is often used with 5 or 10 folds. As such, 5 or 10 models must be constructed and evaluated, greatly adding to the evaluation time of a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, it when the problem is small enough or if you have sufficient compute resources, k-fold cross validation can give you a less biased estimate of the performance of your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below we use the handy [StratifiedKFold](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cross_validation.StratifiedKFold.html) class from the scikit-learn Python machine learning library to split up the training dataset into 10 folds. The folds are stratified, meaning that the algorithm attempts to balance the number of instances of each class in each fold.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example creates and evaluates 10 models using the 10 splits of the data and collects all of the scores. The verbose output for each epoch is turned off by passing verbose=0 to the **fit()** and **evaluate()** functions on the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The performance is printed for each model and it is stored. The average and standard deviation of the model performance is then printed at the end of the run to provide a robust estimate of model accuracy."
