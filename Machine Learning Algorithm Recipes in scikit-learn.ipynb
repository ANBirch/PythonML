    "You have to get your hands dirty.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read all of the blog posts and watch all the videos in the world, but you’re not actually going to start really get machine learning until you start practicing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [scikit-learn Python library](http://machinelearningmastery.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-scikit-learn-a-python-machine-learning-library/) is very easy to get up and running. Nevertheless I see a lot of hesitation from beginners looking get started. In this blog post I want to give a few very simple examples of using scikit-learn for some supervised classification algorithms.\n",

    "## Scikit-Learn Recipes\n",
    "\n",
    "You don’t need to know about and use all of the algorithms in scikit-learn, at least initially, pick one or two (or a handful) and practice with only those.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post you will see 5 recipes of supervised classification algorithms applied to small standard datasets that are provided with the scikit-learn library.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recipes are principled. Each example is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Standalone**: Each code example is a self-contained, complete and executable recipe.\n",
    "- **Just Code**: The focus of each recipe is on the code with minimal exposition on machine learning theory.\n",
    "Simple: Recipes present the common use case, which is probably what you are looking to do.\n",
    "- **Consistent**: All code example are presented consistently and follow the same code pattern and style conventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recipes do not explore the parameters of a given algorithm. They provide a skeleton that you can copy and paste into your file, project or python REPL and start to play with immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "These recipes show you that you can get started practicing with scikit-learn right now. Stop putting it off.\n",

    "## Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression fits a logistic model to data and makes predictions about the probability of an event (between 0 and 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "This recipe shows the fitting of a logistic regression model to the iris dataset. Because this is a mutli-class classification problem and logistic regression makes predictions between 0 and 1, a one-vs-all scheme is used (one model per class)."
